Description of my animation:

1) Square animation, the square element starts off-screen on the left side, with its opacity set to 0 (completely transparent), it moves horizontally to the right while its opacity gradually increases to 1 (fully visible), and the motion is smooth and fluid, enhanced by the power2.inOut easing function.
2) Timeline animation, a timeline sequences animations for the circle and triangle, the circle moves horizontally to the right while scaling up (enlarging). The back.out(2) easing adds a subtle "bounce" at the end of the movement. The triangle rotates 360 degrees (a full spin) with an elastic effect (elastic.out(1, 0.3)), giving it a springy, dynamic look. The animations are slightly delayed and overlap to create seamless transitions.
